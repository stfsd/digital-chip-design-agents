# Skill: RTL Design (SystemVerilog)

## Invocation

When this skill is loaded and a user presents an RTL design task, **do not
execute stages directly**. Immediately spawn the
`digital-chip-design-agents:rtl-design-orchestrator` agent and pass the full
user request and any available context to it. The orchestrator enforces the stage
sequence, loop-back rules, and sign-off criteria defined below.

Use the domain rules in this file only when the orchestrator reads this skill
mid-flow for stage-specific guidance, or when the user asks a targeted reference
question rather than requesting a full flow execution.

## Pre-run Context

Before executing or advising on **any** stage, read the following files if they exist:

1. `memory/rtl-design/knowledge.md` — known failure patterns, successful tool flags, PDK/tool quirks.
   Incorporate its guidance into every stage decision. If absent, proceed without it.
2. `memory/rtl-design/run_state.md` — current run identity (`run_id`, `design_name`, `tool`,
   `last_stage`). Use this to resume correctly after interruption. If absent, a new run
   is starting; the orchestrator will create this file before the first stage.

This pre-run read applies whether this skill is loaded by a user or called by the
orchestrator mid-flow. It ensures the fix database is consulted before any diagnosis step.

## Purpose
Guide RTL development from module hierarchy planning through lint-clean,
CDC-clean, synthesis-ready RTL. Enforces industry-standard SystemVerilog
coding practices and produces a signed-off RTL package ready for simulation
and synthesis handoff.

## Stage: module_planning

### Domain Rules
1. Top-down decomposition: start with top-level module, recurse to leaf cells
2. Each module: single clear responsibility (single responsibility principle)
3. Define all port lists before coding (direction, width, type)
4. Identify all clock domains per module; mark CDC crossings explicitly
5. Identify all reset domains; mark synchronous vs asynchronous
6. Parameterise widths and depths wherever possible
7. No logic in top-level integration modules — wiring only
8. Separate datapath and control into distinct sub-modules

### Output Required
- Module hierarchy tree
- Module descriptor (name, purpose, clock domain, ports, sub-modules) per module
- Interface/port list document

---

## Stage: rtl_coding

### Domain Rules — General
1. Always use `logic` type (not wire/reg distinction)
2. All ports: explicitly typed and directioned
3. `default_nettype none` at top of every file
4. No latches: all always_comb blocks must have complete case and assignment coverage
5. No blocking assignments (=) in always_ff blocks
6. No non-blocking assignments (<=) in always_comb blocks
7. One always block per register or coherent register group
8. Reset all registers explicitly; synchronous reset preferred for ASIC

### Domain Rules — Naming Conventions
- Clocks:       `clk_[domain]`
- Resets:       `rst_n_[domain]` (active-low) or `rst_[domain]`
- Active-low:   `signal_n` suffix
- Registered:   `signal_q` suffix
- Next-state:   `signal_d` suffix
- Parameters:   `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE`
- Modules/Signals: `lower_snake_case`

### Domain Rules — Synthesis Safety
1. No delays (#) in RTL — simulation only
2. No initial blocks in ASIC RTL
3. Use `unique case` with explicit don't-cares instead of casez/casex
4. Flag any net with fanout > 32 for buffering intent review
5. No combinational loops — will cause synthesis errors
6. Pipeline registers: clearly marked with `_q` suffix at each stage

### Domain Rules — CDC
1. Two-FF synchroniser for every single-bit CDC crossing
2. Async FIFO for multi-bit CDC data paths
3. Gray-coded pointers for async FIFO crossing
4. Never sample asynchronous data directly in synchronous logic

### Domain Rules — Power Intent (Clock Gating)
Apply these rules for every clock domain. Read `clock_power_budget` from the architecture
hand-off package if it exists; otherwise classify domains using toggle-count estimates
from Verilator simulation.

1. **High gating opportunity domains** (α < 0.15 from architecture, or toggle rate < 15%
   from Verilator): insert an ICG cell (`CLKGATETST_X*` or technology-equivalent) at the
   outermost clock enable boundary. Do not rely on synthesis to infer clock gates — explicit
   ICG insertion at RTL is required.
2. **Moderate gating opportunity domains** (0.15 ≤ α < 0.40): insert ICG at the
   sub-block level for any register file or datapath wider than 32 bits.
3. **Always-on domains** (α ≥ 0.40, or documented as always-on in architecture hand-off):
   no ICG required; add a `/* always-on: <reason> */` comment at the clock port declaration.
4. ICG enable signal: must be registered (setup-timing safe); combinational enable
   is a lint error.
5. ICG cells: use only library-approved cells (`CLKGATETST_*` for testability with
   scan-enable override); do not use behavioural `if (enable) clk_gated = clk` constructs.
6. After inserting ICGs, measure `clock_gating_coverage`:
   `coverage = (register bits behind an ICG) / (total register bits in domain) × 100%`
   Report this metric in the `rtl_signoff` output.

### Supported Tools for Power Intent

## Stage: lint_check

### Domain Rules
1. ERROR level (must fix): latches, incomplete sensitivity lists,
   undriven outputs, multiply-driven signals, X-propagation sources
2. WARNING level (review): unused ports, truncated assignments,
   bit-width mismatches, constant conditions
3. All waivers: must include signal name, rule ID, justification, approver
4. No ERROR-level waivers without architect approval
5. All waivers logged in `lint_waivers.csv`

### QoR Metrics to Evaluate
- ERROR count: must be 0 before proceeding
- WARNING count: review all; waive with documented justification
- All RTL files checked (not just top-level)

### Output Required
- Lint report (per file, per rule)
- Waiver file
- Clean lint summary

## Stage: cdc_rdc_analysis

### CDC Rules
1. Every CDC crossing: approved synchroniser primitive
2. Single-bit control: 2-FF synchroniser minimum
3. Multi-bit data: async FIFO or handshake protocol
4. Pulse crossings: pulse stretcher + synchroniser
5. Zero CDC violations (unwaived) before proceeding

### RDC Rules
1. All reset domains explicitly defined in constraints
2. Reset de-assertion: synchronous to receiving clock domain
3. No combinational logic between reset sources
4. Retention registers: correct UPF annotation

### QoR Metrics to Evaluate
- CDC violations (unwaived): 0
- RDC violations (unwaived): 0
- All clock domains verified in tool constraints

### Output Required
- CDC/RDC report
- Synchroniser instance list
- Waiver file

---

## Stage: synth_check

### Domain Rules
1. Run synthesis at target frequency with typical corner
2. Check for unmapped cells (technology library gaps)
3. Identify critical paths — report to architect if WNS < −0.5 ns
4. Check area vs microarch estimate (< 120% acceptable)
5. Check for multi-driven nets or unresolved X
6. Flag high-fanout nets needing buffering strategy
7. Verify all clock definitions synthesise correctly

### QoR Metrics to Evaluate
- WNS at target frequency: > −0.5 ns acceptable at this stage
- Area: < 120% of microarch estimate
- No unmapped cells
- No multi-driven nets

### Output Required
- Synthesis area report
- Timing report (critical paths)
- Recommendations for RTL fixes if needed

## Memory

### Write on stage completion
After each stage completes (regardless of whether an orchestrator session is active),
write or overwrite one JSON record in `memory/rtl-design/experiences.jsonl` keyed by
`run_id`. This ensures data is persisted even if the flow is interrupted or called
without full orchestrator context.

Use `run_id` = `rtl-design_<YYYYMMDD>_<HHMMSS>` (set once at flow start; reuse on each
stage update). Set `signoff_achieved: false` until the final sign-off stage completes.
### Run state (write before first stage, update after each stage)
Write `memory/rtl-design/run_state.md` as the **first action** before launching any tool:
```markdown
run_id:      rtl-design_<YYYYMMDD>_<HHMMSS>
design_name: <design>
tool:        <primary tool>
start_time:  <ISO-8601>
last_stage:  <first stage name>
```
Update `last_stage` after each stage completes. This file lets wakeup-loop prompts
and resumed sessions identify the correct run without relying on in-memory state.
Create the file and parent directories if they do not exist.

### Optional: claude-mem index
If `mcp__plugin_ecc_memory__add_observations` is available in this session, emit each
applied fix as an observation to entity `chip-design-rtl-design-fixes` after writing to
`experiences.jsonl`. Skip silently if the tool is absent — JSONL is the canonical record.
