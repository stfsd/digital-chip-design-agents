# Skill: Functional Verification (UVM)

## Invocation

When this skill is loaded and a user presents a verification task, **do not
execute stages directly**. Immediately spawn the
`digital-chip-design-agents:verification-orchestrator` agent and pass the full
user request and any available context to it. The orchestrator enforces the stage
sequence, loop-back rules, and sign-off criteria defined below.

Use the domain rules in this file only when the orchestrator reads this skill
mid-flow for stage-specific guidance, or when the user asks a targeted reference
question rather than requesting a full flow execution.

## Purpose
Guide the complete UVM functional verification flow from testbench architecture
through coverage-closed regression sign-off. Produces a verified RTL package
with documented coverage and a clean regression.

## Stage: tb_architecture

### Domain Rules
1. Follow UVM 1.2 standard (IEEE 1800.2)
2. One UVM agent per DUT interface (driver, monitor, sequencer)
3. Active agents: drive stimulus; passive agents: monitor only
4. Scoreboard: checks DUT output against reference model output
5. Reference model: functional model of DUT — SystemVerilog or C++ via DPI
6. Coverage collector: separate component from scoreboard
7. Virtual sequencer: coordinates multi-agent stimulus scenarios
8. All TB parameters via uvm_config_db — no hardcoded values in components

### UVM Hierarchy Template
```
uvm_test
  └─ uvm_env
       ├─ agent_A (active)   driver + monitor + sequencer
       ├─ agent_B (passive)  monitor only
       ├─ scoreboard
       ├─ coverage_collector
       └─ virtual_sequencer
```

### QoR Metrics to Evaluate
- All DUT interfaces covered by an agent
- Reference model: adequate to check all DUT outputs
- TB compile: 0 errors

### Output Required
- TB architecture diagram
- UVM component list and hierarchy
- Interface-to-agent mapping table

---

## Stage: test_planning

### Domain Rules
1. Every functional requirement → at least one directed test
2. Every interface → protocol compliance test
3. Error/exception cases: explicit directed tests (not left to random)
4. Corner cases: boundary values, max/min, overflow, underflow
5. Concurrency: multi-threaded stimulus for pipeline stress
6. Back-pressure: tests under flow control conditions
7. Reset: in-operation resets, reset during active transaction
8. Define covergroups before writing tests

### V-Plan Entry Template (per feature)
```
feature_id:   F001
description:  AXI write burst handling
tests:        [direct_single_write, burst_len_256, narrow_transfer]
assertions:   [axi_valid_stable, axi_handshake_check]
covergroups:  [burst_len_cg, burst_type_cg]
priority:     P0
```

### QoR Metrics to Evaluate
- Requirement coverage: 100% of spec features mapped
- P0 tests: must pass before random testing begins
- Estimated test count: reasonable vs schedule

### Output Required
- V-plan document
- Covergroup definitions
- Assertion list with expected behaviour

---

## Stage: uvm_tb_build

### Domain Rules — Sequences
1. Base sequence: minimum valid transaction
2. Extended sequences: specific scenarios from V-plan
3. Sequence library: register all sequences for random selection
4. Never hardcode values — use randomised fields with constraints

### Domain Rules — Drivers
1. Drive signals cycle-accurate to protocol specification
2. Handle back-pressure: check ready/valid correctly
3. Protocol assertion in driver to catch illegal stimulus early

### Domain Rules — Scoreboard
1. Predict expected output from reference model before DUT output arrives
2. Report mismatches with full context (stimulus, expected, actual)
3. Track: total checks, pass, fail, untriggered

### Domain Rules — SVA Assertions
1. Protocol assertions: in interface bind, not DUT
2. Functional assertions: in checker or bind module
3. All assertions: clearly named with descriptive failure message

### QoR Metrics to Evaluate
- TB compile: 0 errors, 0 warnings
- Sanity test: passes with known-good RTL
- All components active in simulation log

### Output Required
- UVM component source files
- SVA assertion files (bind-based)
- Compile script

---

## Stage: directed_tests

### Domain Rules
1. Implement one directed test per V-plan entry — tests must be deterministic
2. Each test: verify the exact functional requirement it targets (no catch-all tests)
3. Error/exception paths: explicit stimulus to trigger each one
4. Corner cases: boundary values, max/min, overflow, underflow — one test each
5. Reset during active transaction: at least one test per interface
6. P0 tests must all pass before constrained-random phase begins
7. DUT bug found during directed test: **suspend flow immediately** — do not continue
   to constrained-random; flag RTL fix required and wait for confirmation

### QoR Metrics to Evaluate
- All V-plan features covered by at least one directed test
- P0 directed tests: 100% pass before proceeding
- 0 UVM FATAL or ERROR during directed test phase

### Output Required
- Directed test source files (one UVM sequence per feature)
- Directed test pass/fail report
- Bug report (if any DUT bugs found)

---

## Stage: constrained_random

### Domain Rules
1. Constraint blocks: randomise all stimulus fields within protocol-legal ranges
2. Bias constraints: weight toward uncovered coverage bins identified in prior runs
3. Seeds: use at least 10 distinct seeds before evaluating coverage
4. Scoreboards active throughout: every transaction checked against reference model
5. Any UVM FATAL: stop immediately — do not accumulate errors across seeds
6. Any scoreboard mismatch: classify as DUT bug or testbench bug before continuing
7. Run until coverage targets are met or max seed budget exhausted

### QoR Metrics to Evaluate
- Functional coverage: trending toward 100% across seeds
- No persistent scoreboard mismatches (classify and fix before more seeds)
- Regression pass rate: 100% (no failing seeds)

### Output Required
- Coverage report (merged across all seeds run so far)
- Uncovered bin list for directed test closure
- Seed log (seed number, pass/fail, coverage achieved)

---

## Stage: coverage_analysis

### Coverage Targets
| Type | Target | Priority |
|------|--------|----------|
| Functional (V-plan) | 100% | P0 |
| Code Line | ≥ 95% | P1 |
| Code Branch | ≥ 90% | P1 |
| Code Toggle | ≥ 85% | P2 |
| FSM State | 100% | P0 |
| FSM Transition | ≥ 95% | P0 |
| Assertion triggered | 100% | P1 |

### Closure Strategy
1. Identify uncovered bins after N random seeds
2. Write targeted directed tests for hard-to-hit bins
3. Adjust constraints to bias toward uncovered areas
4. Waive unreachable bins with justification (dead code)

### QoR Metrics to Evaluate
- Functional coverage: 100% (no unwaived misses)
- Code coverage: per targets above
- Waiver file: all entries approved by verification lead

### Output Required
- Coverage report (merged across all seeds)
- Uncovered bin list with closure plan
- Waiver file

---

## Stage: formal_assist

### Use Cases for Formal
1. Protocol compliance: prove handshake never violates
2. Deadlock freedom: prove no state where valid=1 and ready never comes
3. Liveness: every request eventually gets a response
4. One-hot FSM: state encoding never has 0 or >1 bits set
5. Coverage closure: hit bins unreachable by simulation

### Domain Rules
1. Write properties in concurrent SVA
2. Group properties by feature in separate .sva files
3. Constrain environment with assumptions that match valid stimulus
4. Run vacuity check: assumption disabled → property should NOT hold
5. Bound liveness properties (##[1:BOUND])

### QoR Metrics to Evaluate
- All properties: PROVEN or clearly UNREACHABLE
- No vacuous proofs
- Additional coverage bins closed vs simulation baseline

### Output Required
- SVA property file
- Formal run report (proven/failed/vacuous per property)
- CEX waveform descriptions for any failures

| Weekly | Weekly gate | < 48 hr | Full suite, 1000 seeds |
| Sign-off | Tape-out gate | Unlimited | Full suite, 10,000 seeds |
