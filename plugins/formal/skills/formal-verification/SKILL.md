# Skill: Formal Verification (FPV + LEC)

## Invocation

When this skill is loaded and a user presents a formal verification task, **do not
execute stages directly**. Immediately spawn the
`digital-chip-design-agents:formal-orchestrator` agent and pass the full user
request and any available context to it. The orchestrator enforces the stage
sequence, loop-back rules, and sign-off criteria defined below.

Use the domain rules in this file only when the orchestrator reads this skill
mid-flow for stage-specific guidance, or when the user asks a targeted reference
question rather than requesting a full flow execution.

## Purpose
Exhaustively prove design properties and equivalence using formal methods.
Complements simulation-based verification for correctness proofs, protocol
compliance, and equivalence checking between RTL and gate-level netlists.

## Stage: property_planning

### Property Categories
1. **Safety**: "something bad never happens"
   `assert property (@(posedge clk) !(error && valid));`
2. **Liveness**: "something good eventually happens" (always bound the interval)
   `assert property (@(posedge clk) req |-> ##[1:MAX] ack);`
3. **Stability**: "output is stable while condition holds"
   `assert property (@(posedge clk) valid |-> $stable(data));`
4. **Reachability**: "a state is reachable" (use cover, not assert)
   `cover property (@(posedge clk) state == DONE);`

### Domain Rules
1. Every spec feature: at least one property or cover point
2. All properties: include descriptive name and failure message
3. Liveness properties: always bound with ##[1:BOUND]
4. Use `$past()`, `$rose()`, `$fell()` over manual delay logic
5. `disable iff`: use for reset gating

### QoR Metrics to Evaluate
- All spec features mapped to property or cover
- Cover points: key states are reachable

### Output Required
- Property plan (feature → property mapping)
- SVA property file (.sva)
- SVA assumption file

## Stage: environment_setup

### Domain Rules
1. Constrain all primary inputs to legal values only
2. Protocol assumptions: model upstream block behaviour
3. Reset assumption: force correct reset sequence at time 0
4. **Over-constraining → vacuous proof** (nothing can be proven wrong) — always run vacuity check
5. **Under-constraining → false CEX** (environment bug, not DUT) — check all CEX carefully
6. Vacuity check: disable each assume — property should NOT hold without it
7. Document every assumption with justification

### Common Assumption Templates
```systemverilog
// Reset sequence
assume property (@(posedge clk) $rose(rst_n) |-> ##[1:5] rst_n);

// AXI valid stability
assume property (@(posedge clk)
  (s_axi_awvalid && !s_axi_awready) |=> $stable(s_axi_awaddr));
```

### QoR Metrics to Evaluate
- Vacuity check: PASS for all properties
- No over-constraining: formal tool reports reasonable state space
- Environment signed off by verification lead

### Output Required
- Formal environment file (constraints/assumptions)
- Vacuity check report
- Environment review record

## Stage: fpv_run

### Result Classifications
| Result | Meaning | Action |
|--------|---------|--------|
| PROVEN | Holds for all reachable states | Log and continue |
| CEX | Counterexample found | Analyse; fix RTL or assumption |
| VACUOUS | Antecedent never fires | Fix assumption or property |
| INCONCLUSIVE | Bound too small or state space too large | Increase bound / abstract |
| UNREACHABLE | Cover never reachable | Verify or waive |

### Strategies for Inconclusive
1. Increase BMC bound (k-induction)
2. Apply abstractions (data abstraction, counter abstraction)
3. Decompose: prove sub-properties; compose to main property
4. Document as "assumed correct" with justification if intractable

### QoR Metrics to Evaluate
- Target: 100% PROVEN or UNREACHABLE (no unanalysed CEX)
- All INCONCLUSIVE: documented with justification and bound used

### Output Required
- FPV run report (per property: result, CEX trace if applicable)
- CEX waveform descriptions for failures

---

## Stage: cex_analysis

### Domain Rules
1. Every CEX: determine if it is a real DUT bug or an assumption/environment bug
2. Real DUT bug: fix RTL → re-run FPV (counts as RTL bug, not formal bug)
3. Assumption bug: tighten assumption → re-run vacuity check
4. False CEX from under-constraining: document clearly before adding assumption
5. Never waive a CEX without root cause

### Output Required
- CEX analysis report (bug or false alarm, root cause, fix applied)

## Stage: lec_run

### LEC Flow
1. Read golden: RTL or pre-ECO netlist
2. Read revised: post-synthesis netlist or post-ECO netlist
3. Map points: match sequential/combinational key points
4. Verify all points: compare cone-of-influence
5. Report: EQUIVALENT / UNMATCHED / ABORTED

### Domain Rules
1. Use same SDC for both golden and revised
2. Scan mode: flatten scan chains or use scan-unaware mode
3. Black boxes: handle consistently in both netlists
4. Unmatched points: must be root-caused — not waived without RTL team approval
5. Post-ECO: run LEC after every ECO, not just at sign-off

### Common LEC Failures
| Failure | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| Optimizer removed logic | Verify with report_removal; add set_dont_touch if needed |
| SDC mismatch | Ensure same clock groupings in both netlists |
| Scan chain reordering | Use scan-unaware LEC mode |
| Black box mismatch | Align black box list in both netlists |

### QoR Metrics to Evaluate
- All compare points: EQUIVALENT
- 0 UNMATCHED points
- 0 ABORTED points

### Output Required
- LEC run report
- Unmatched point analysis (if any)
- EQUIVALENT sign-off record

## Memory

### Write on stage completion
After each stage completes (regardless of whether an orchestrator session is active),
write or overwrite one JSON record in `memory/formal/experiences.jsonl` keyed by
`run_id`. This ensures data is persisted even if the flow is interrupted or called
without full orchestrator context.

Use `run_id` = `formal_<YYYYMMDD>_<HHMMSS>` (set once at flow start; reuse on each
stage update). Set `signoff_achieved: false` until the final sign-off stage completes.
