# Skill: SoC IP Integration

## Invocation

When this skill is loaded and a user presents a SoC integration task, **do not
execute stages directly**. Immediately spawn the
`digital-chip-design-agents:soc-integration-orchestrator` agent and pass the full
user request and any available context to it. The orchestrator enforces the stage
sequence, loop-back rules, and sign-off criteria defined below.

Use the domain rules in this file only when the orchestrator reads this skill
mid-flow for stage-specific guidance, or when the user asks a targeted reference
question rather than requesting a full flow execution.

## Pre-run Context

Before executing or advising on **any** stage, read the following files if they exist:

1. `memory/soc/knowledge.md` — known failure patterns, successful tool flags, PDK/tool quirks.
   Incorporate its guidance into every stage decision. If absent, proceed without it.
2. `memory/soc/run_state.md` — current run identity (`run_id`, `design_name`, `tool`,
   `last_stage`). Use this to resume correctly after interruption. If absent, a new run
   is starting; the orchestrator will create this file before the first stage.

This pre-run read applies whether this skill is loaded by a user or called by the
orchestrator mid-flow. It ensures the fix database is consulted before any diagnosis step.

## Purpose
Assemble a complete SoC from first-party RTL, licensed hard/soft IPs, and
memory macros. Covers IP procurement, bus fabric configuration, top-level
integration, and chip-level simulation sign-off.

## Stage: ip_procurement

### IP Qualification Checklist

- [ ] Databook: register map, timing diagrams, integration guide?
- [ ] DFT: scan-enabled? BIST available?
- [ ] Silicon proven: on which node?
- [ ] Support SLA: bug-fix and update commitment?

### Hard IP vs Soft IP
| Aspect | Hard IP (GDSII) | Soft IP (RTL) |
|--------|----------------|---------------|
| Area | Fixed | Synthesis-dependent |
| Timing | Characterised libs only | Optimisable |
| PD effort | Place as macro | Full PD flow |
| Customisation | None | Parameterisable |

### Memory Macro Qualification
1. Verify compiler-generated views: .lib, .lef, .v (behavioural)
2. Check access time vs target frequency
3. Verify retention/power-down modes (for UPF power domains)
4. Confirm MBIST ports available

### Output Required
- IP qualification report per IP
- IP deliverable checklist (all views received)
- IP risk register (gaps in deliverables)

## Stage: ip_configuration

### Domain Rules
1. Configure each IP per its databook for target use case
2. Parameterise data widths, FIFO depths, feature enables
3. Verify configured timing meets target frequency at worst-case corner
4. Verify interface widths match bus fabric port requirements
5. Generate integration wrapper if IP port names differ from system conventions

### Output Required
- Configured IP files and wrappers
- Timing verification report (configured corner)

## Stage: bus_fabric_setup

### Bus Fabric Selection
| Fabric Type | Use Case | Bandwidth |
|-------------|---------|-----------|
| AXI4 Crossbar | High-bandwidth data paths | High |
| AXI4-Lite | Low-bandwidth control registers | Low |
| APB3 | Peripheral register access | Low |
| NoC | Many-core topologies | Very High |

### Domain Rules
1. Non-overlapping address regions for all slaves
2. AXI width adapters for any width mismatches
3. Async bridges for all cross-clock-domain connections
4. QoS: assign traffic class for latency-sensitive masters
5. Error handling: out-of-range address → DECERR response defined

### Memory Map Validation
- No address region overlaps
- All peripherals accessible from all required masters
- Reserved regions return DECERR
- No unintended address aliasing

### QoR Metrics to Evaluate
- Address decode: complete, no gaps, no overlaps
- All IP blocks connected with correct port width
- CDC bridges in place for all clock crossings

### Output Required
- Bus fabric configuration file
- Memory map document (final, versioned)
- Address decoder verification report

## Stage: top_integration

### Domain Rules
1. Top module: wiring only — no logic at top level
2. All IPs instantiated once (no unintended duplicates)
3. All ports connected — lint check for unconnected active signals
4. Clock generation: PLL/mux module at or near top level
5. Reset generation: synchroniser per domain at top level
6. Tie cells: VDD/VSS tie-offs for all floating inputs
7. Scan chain: SI/SO routed through scan backbone
8. JTAG: TDI/TDO routed through JTAG chain

### Integration Checklist (per IP)
- [ ] Correct module name and parameters
- [ ] All active ports connected
- [ ] Clock: correct domain
- [ ] Reset: correct domain and polarity
- [ ] Power ports: correct UPF domain
- [ ] Scan: SI/SO connected

### Common Integration Bugs
| Bug | Consequence |
|-----|------------|
| Wrong clock domain | Metastability in silicon |
| Reset polarity inversion | Block never exits reset |
| Unconnected valid/enable | Block runs freely or never |
| AXI address offset wrong | Peripheral at wrong base address |

### Output Required
- Top-level RTL (soc_top.sv)
- Integration lint report
- IP connectivity summary

## Stage: chip_level_sim

### Required Tests
1. Boot test: CPU boots from reset vector, executes code
2. Peripheral access: read/write all peripheral registers
3. DMA: transfers between memory regions verified
4. Interrupt: each peripheral can interrupt CPU and ISR fires
5. Multi-master: concurrent bus access from multiple masters
6. Clock switching: clock mux operates correctly
7. Power modes: enter and exit sleep/deep-sleep
8. Reset: warm and cold reset; all blocks re-initialise

### QoR Metrics to Evaluate
- All peripheral register tests: PASS
- Boot test: CPU reaches application code
- DMA: correct data at correct address
- No AXI protocol violations (checker clean)
- No X propagation at key outputs after reset

### Output Required
- Chip-level simulation report

## Memory

### Write on stage completion
After each stage completes (regardless of whether an orchestrator session is active),
write or overwrite one JSON record in `memory/soc/experiences.jsonl` keyed by
`run_id`. This ensures data is persisted even if the flow is interrupted or called
without full orchestrator context.

Use `run_id` = `soc_<YYYYMMDD>_<HHMMSS>` (set once at flow start; reuse on each
stage update). Set `signoff_achieved: false` until the final sign-off stage completes.
### Run state (write before first stage, update after each stage)
Write `memory/soc/run_state.md` as the **first action** before launching any tool:
```markdown
run_id:      soc_<YYYYMMDD>_<HHMMSS>
design_name: <design>
tool:        <primary tool>
start_time:  <ISO-8601>
last_stage:  <first stage name>
```
Update `last_stage` after each stage completes. This file lets wakeup-loop prompts
and resumed sessions identify the correct run without relying on in-memory state.
Create the file and parent directories if they do not exist.

### Optional: claude-mem index
If `mcp__plugin_ecc_memory__add_observations` is available in this session, emit each
applied fix as an observation to entity `chip-design-soc-fixes` after writing to
`experiences.jsonl`. Skip silently if the tool is absent — JSONL is the canonical record.
