  Distil accumulated experience records (experiences.jsonl) into updated domain knowledge
  summaries (knowledge.md) for any chip-design domain. Run after every 10 orchestrator
  sessions, or on demand when a domain has collected new issue/fix patterns.

# Skill: Memory Keeper

## Invocation

```
/chip-design-infrastructure:memory-keeper [--domain <name>] [--all] [--min-records <n>]
```

- `--domain <name>` — distil a single domain (e.g. `synthesis`, `sta`, `pd`)
- `--all` — distil every domain that has an `experiences.jsonl` with enough records
- `--min-records <n>` — minimum record count to proceed (default: 5); skip domains below threshold

If neither `--domain` nor `--all` is given, prompt the user to choose.

---

## Purpose

Orchestrators write one JSON record to `memory/<domain>/experiences.jsonl` after every run.
Over time those records accumulate issue descriptions, applied fixes, metric ranges, and
tool-flag observations. This skill reads that evidence and merges the new learnings into
`memory/<domain>/knowledge.md` — the Tier-2 summary that every orchestrator reads at session
start. Without periodic distillation, knowledge.md drifts stale while the evidence log grows.

---

## Domains

Valid domain names match the subdirectories under `memory/`:

| Domain | JSONL path |
|--------|-----------|
| `architecture` | `memory/architecture/experiences.jsonl` |
| `compiler` | `memory/compiler/experiences.jsonl` |
| `dft` | `memory/dft/experiences.jsonl` |
| `firmware` | `memory/firmware/experiences.jsonl` |
| `formal` | `memory/formal/experiences.jsonl` |
| `fpga` | `memory/fpga/experiences.jsonl` |
| `hls` | `memory/hls/experiences.jsonl` |
| `pd` | `memory/pd/experiences.jsonl` |
| `rtl-design` | `memory/rtl-design/experiences.jsonl` |
| `soc` | `memory/soc/experiences.jsonl` |
| `sta` | `memory/sta/experiences.jsonl` |
| `synthesis` | `memory/synthesis/experiences.jsonl` |
| `verification` | `memory/verification/experiences.jsonl` |

---

## Stage: load_experiences

### Rules

1. Read `memory/<domain>/experiences.jsonl` (one JSON object per line).
2. Count valid records. If count < `--min-records` (default 5), print a skip notice and
   stop — not enough signal to distil.
3. If the file does not exist or is empty, skip with the same notice.
4. Parse every record into an in-memory list. Ignore malformed lines (log a warning).
5. Group records along three axes for the analysis stage:
   - **Issues + fixes**: collect all `issues_encountered` and `fixes_applied` strings
   - **Tool flags**: scan `notes` and `fixes_applied` for explicit flag/command patterns
     (lines containing `-`, `--`, or backtick-quoted commands)
   - **Metric ranges**: for each numeric field in `key_metrics`, collect the list of values
     across all records; compute min, max, median, and the most recent value

### Output

Structured summary object (in-memory) passed to `distil_knowledge`:
```
{
  "domain": "<domain>",
  "record_count": <n>,
  "date_range": ["<oldest ISO-8601>", "<newest ISO-8601>"],
  "signoff_rate": <fraction>,
  "issue_fix_pairs": [{"issue": "...", "fix": "...", "count": <n>}, ...],
  "tool_flag_candidates": ["<flag or command fragment>", ...],
  "metric_ranges": {
    "<metric_field>": {"min": x, "max": y, "median": z, "latest": w}
  },
  "free_notes": ["<note string>", ...]
}
```

---

## Stage: distil_knowledge

### Rules

1. Read the **existing** `memory/<domain>/knowledge.md` in full.
2. Using the structured summary from `load_experiences`, identify new evidence that is
   **not already captured** in the current knowledge.md:
   - New issue/fix pairs not yet present under **Known Failure Patterns**
   - New successful flags not yet under **Successful Tool Flags**
   - PDK or tool quirks mentioned in notes not yet under **PDK / Tool Quirks**
3. For each new finding, draft a concise bullet following the style of existing entries:
   - Lead with the symptom or scenario in **bold**
   - Follow with the cause and the fix in plain prose
   - Keep each entry to 2–4 sentences maximum
4. Merge new entries **below** existing entries in the relevant section — never delete or
   overwrite an existing entry unless it directly contradicts new evidence (note the
   contradiction explicitly).
5. If the signoff rate across records is < 50%, add a note in the **Notes** section
   flagging common failure modes that did not reach signoff.
6. Update the `## Notes` section with a distillation timestamp:
   `_Last distilled: <ISO-8601 date> from <n> experience records._`
   Replace any previous such line.
7. Write the updated content back to `memory/<domain>/knowledge.md`.

### Merge Policy

| Scenario | Action |
|----------|--------|
| New issue/fix not in knowledge.md | Add under Known Failure Patterns |
| Existing entry confirmed by ≥ 3 records | Add `(confirmed across N runs)` annotation |
| Existing entry contradicted by ≥ 3 records | Strike through old text, add corrected entry |
| New tool flag observed in ≥ 2 records | Add under Successful Tool Flags |
| Single-record observation | Add only if `signoff_achieved: true` and notes are detailed |

### Output Required

- Updated `memory/<domain>/knowledge.md`
- Console summary: how many new entries were added per section, and how many existing
  entries were annotated or corrected

---

## Stage: report

### Rules

1. Print a per-domain distillation report:
   ```
   Domain:        <domain>
   Records read:  <n>
   Date range:    <oldest> → <newest>
   Signoff rate:  <pct>%
   New entries:   +<k> Known Failure Patterns, +<j> Successful Tool Flags, +<i> PDK Quirks
   Annotations:   <m> existing entries updated
   knowledge.md:  memory/<domain>/knowledge.md  [updated]
   ```
2. If `--all` was used, print a summary table across all processed domains.
3. If any domain was skipped (too few records), list them with their current record count.

- [ ] Existing `knowledge.md` read without modification during analysis
- [ ] New entries drafted in the style of existing entries
- [ ] Contradicted entries flagged, not silently overwritten

## Example Invocations

```bash
# Distil synthesis domain (must have ≥ 5 records)
/chip-design-infrastructure:memory-keeper --domain synthesis

# Distil all domains with ≥ 10 records
/chip-design-infrastructure:memory-keeper --all --min-records 10

# Force distillation even with 3 records (debugging or early feedback)
/chip-design-infrastructure:memory-keeper --domain sta --min-records 3
```
