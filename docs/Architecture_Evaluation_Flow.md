## 4. Skill File Specifications

### 4.1 `sv-arch-spec/SKILL.md`

```markdown
# Skill: Architecture — Specification Analysis

## Purpose
Decompose product specification into formal architectural requirements,
identify ambiguities, and produce a structured requirements document.

## Domain Rules
1. Classify requirements: functional, performance, power, area, interface
2. Identify under-specified areas and flag for clarification
3. Map use cases to required hardware blocks (datapath, control, memory, IO)
4. Extract interface requirements: protocols (AXI, PCIe, USB, Ethernet, etc.)
5. Identify safety/security requirements (ISO 26262, FIPS, etc.) if applicable
6. Assign priority to each requirement: Must-Have / Should-Have / Nice-to-Have

## QoR Metrics
- Requirements coverage: all spec sections mapped to arch requirement
- Ambiguity count: flag any unresolved spec ambiguities
- Interface completeness: all external interfaces identified

## Output Required
- Structured requirements document (JSON or Markdown)
- Interface list with protocols and bandwidths
- Open questions list for product/system team
```

### 4.2 `sv-arch-exploration/SKILL.md`

```markdown
# Skill: Architecture — Microarchitecture Exploration

## Purpose
Enumerate and evaluate candidate microarchitecture options against
performance, power, and area targets.

## Domain Rules
1. Generate at least 3 candidate architectures (conservative, balanced, aggressive)
2. Evaluate pipeline depth trade-offs (deeper = higher frequency, more area/power)
3. Evaluate parallelism options: SIMD, superscalar, spatial unrolling
4. Cache/memory hierarchy: size, associativity, latency vs area trade-off
5. Interconnect topology: bus, crossbar, NoC — evaluate bandwidth vs complexity
6. Consider IP reuse: identify available hard macros or licensed IPs
7. Document assumptions for each candidate

## Trade-off Matrix Template
| Candidate | Freq Target | Area Est. | Power Est. | Risk | Notes |
|-----------|-------------|-----------|------------|------|-------|
| Option A  | 1GHz        | 3mm2      | 300mW      | Low  | ...   |
| Option B  | 2GHz        | 6mm2      | 700mW      | High | ...   |

## QoR Metrics
- Number of candidates explored: minimum 3
- Each candidate: performance estimate within 20% of target
- Recommendation: single preferred candidate with rationale

## Output Required
- Trade-off matrix
- Recommended candidate with justification
- Assumptions and risks per candidate
```

### 4.3 `sv-arch-perf/SKILL.md`

```markdown
# Skill: Architecture — Performance Modelling

## Purpose
Build analytical or simulation-based performance models to validate
that the selected microarchitecture meets throughput and latency targets.

## Domain Rules
1. Use analytical models (Amdahl, Roofline) for initial estimates
2. Build transaction-level models (TLM/SystemC or Python) for complex pipelines
3. Model all bottlenecks: compute, memory bandwidth, IO throughput
4. Sweep key parameters: clock frequency, parallelism, cache size
5. Validate with representative workloads from use-case list
6. Include best/typical/worst-case scenarios

## QoR Metrics
- Throughput: must meet or exceed target by ≥ 10% margin
- Latency: must meet target at worst-case workload
- Memory bandwidth: must not exceed DRAM/SRAM bandwidth limit
- Model confidence: flag if model assumptions are unvalidated

## Output Required
- Performance model (script or spreadsheet)
- Throughput/latency results per use case
- Sensitivity analysis (which parameter matters most)
- Comparison against targets
```

### 4.4 `sv-arch-ppa/SKILL.md`

```markdown
# Skill: Architecture — Power and Area Estimation

## Purpose
Produce early-stage power and area estimates for the selected
microarchitecture before RTL is written.

## Domain Rules
1. Use technology library scaling data for area estimates (gates/mm2)
2. Activity-based dynamic power estimate: P = alpha * C * V^2 * f
3. Leakage estimate: from library characterization at target Vt mix
4. Memory area: use compiler estimates (SRAM, ROM, register files)
5. IO pad area: per pad ring design rules
6. Apply 15–20% margin to all estimates (RTL is never minimal)
7. Compare against budget; flag if estimate exceeds 80% of budget

## Clock Gating Opportunity Analysis
Using activity factors already collected for dynamic power:

1. For each clock domain, record activity factor α from use-case workload sweep.
2. Classify each domain:
   - α < 0.15 — **high gating opportunity**: flag as must-have RTL requirement
   - 0.15 ≤ α < 0.40 — **moderate gating opportunity**: flag as should-have RTL requirement
   - α ≥ 0.40 — **always-active**: document as always-on; no ICG needed
3. Produce a `clock_power_budget` table (one row per domain):

   | Domain | Frequency | α (activity) | Est. Clock Power (mW) | Gating Class |
   |--------|-----------|-------------|----------------------|--------------|
   | core   | 1 GHz     | 0.08        | 45                   | high         |
   | dsp    | 500 MHz   | 0.55        | 30                   | always-on    |

4. Include `clock_power_budget` table in the RTL hand-off package.

## QoR Metrics
- Area estimate: < 80% of budget (to allow RTL overhead margin)
- Dynamic power: < 80% of budget
- Leakage power: < 15% of total estimated power
- Clock-gating coverage: ≥ 60% of register-bank bits in high-opportunity domains
- Confidence level: HIGH / MEDIUM / LOW (based on model fidelity)

## Output Required
- Area breakdown by block
- Power breakdown: dynamic, leakage, per domain
- Comparison against targets with margin analysis
- `clock_power_budget` table (domain → frequency, activity factor, estimated clock power, gating class)
```

### 4.5 `sv-arch-risk/SKILL.md`

```markdown
# Skill: Architecture — Risk Assessment

## Purpose
Identify, classify, and propose mitigations for technical risks
in the selected microarchitecture.

## Domain Rules
1. Risk categories: schedule, technical feasibility, IP availability,
   tool support, verification complexity, power closure
2. Score each risk: Probability (1–5) × Impact (1–5) = Risk Score
3. Flag any risk score ≥ 15 as HIGH — requires mitigation plan
4. IP risks: verify availability and licensing timeline
5. Tool risks: verify EDA tool support for chosen technology
6. Verification risks: estimate TB complexity; flag if > 6 months est.

## QoR Metrics
- No unmitigated HIGH risks at sign-off
- All risks have assigned owner and mitigation plan
- Schedule risk: total identified risks vs team capacity

## Output Required
- Risk register (ID, description, score, mitigation, owner)
- Top 5 risks highlighted for management review
```

### 4.6 `sv-arch-signoff/SKILL.md`

## 6. Orchestrator Specification

### System Prompt

```
You are the Architecture Evaluation Orchestrator for chip design.

You receive a product specification and guide a multi-stage evaluation
that produces a validated microarchitecture document.

STAGE SEQUENCE:
  spec_analysis → arch_exploration → perf_modelling →
  power_area_estimation → risk_assessment → arch_signoff

LOOP-BACK RULES:
  - perf_modelling FAIL          → arch_exploration (max 3x)
  - power_area_estimation FAIL   → arch_exploration (max 2x)
  - risk_assessment: HIGH risks  → risk_assessment (max 2x)
  - arch_signoff FAIL            → spec_analysis if coverage gap (max 1x)
                                 → arch_exploration if PPA gap (max 2x)

On completion, produce a microarchitecture document and hand-off
package for the RTL design team.
